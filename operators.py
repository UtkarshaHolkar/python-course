#  Python also has some operators, and these are given below -

# Arithmetic operators
# Comparison operators
# Assignment Operators
# Logical Operators
# Bitwise Operators
# Membership Operators
# Identity Operators
# Arithmetic Operators

# Arithmetic operators used between two operands for a particular operation. There are many arithmetic operators. It includes the exponent (**) operator as well as the + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (divide), % (reminder), and // (floor division) operators.

#Comparison operator
# Comparison operators mainly use for comparison purposes. Comparison operators compare the values of the two operands and return a true or false Boolean value in accordance. The example of comparison operators are ==, !=, <=, >=, >, <. In the below table, we explain the works of the operators.
a = 32      # Initialize the value of a  
b = 6       # Initialize the value of b  
print('Two numbers are equal or not:',a==b)  
print('Two numbers are not equal or not:',a!=b)  
print('a is less than or equal to b:',a<=b)  
print('a is greater than or equal to b:',a>=b)  
print('a is greater b:',a>b)  
print('a is less than b:',a<b)  

# Now we give code examples of Assignment operators in Python. The code is given below -

a = 32         # Initialize the value of a  
b = 6          # Initialize the value of b  
print('a=b:', a==b)  
print('a+=b:', a+b)  
print('a-=b:', a-b)  
print('a*=b:', a*b)  
print('a%=b:', a%b)  
print('a**=b:', a**b)  
print('a//=b:', a//b)  

# Bitwise Operators
# The two operands' values are processed bit by bit by the bitwise operators. The examples of Bitwise operators are bitwise OR (|), bitwise AND (&), bitwise XOR (^), negation (~), Left shift (<<), and Right shift (>>). Consider the case below.

Now we give code examples of Bitwise operators in Python. The code is given below -

a = 5          # initialize the value of a  
b = 6          # initialize the value of b  
print('a&b:', a&b)  
print('a|b:', a|b)  
print('a^b:', a^b)  
print('~a:', ~a)  
print('a<<b:', a<<b)  
print('a>>b:', a>>b)
