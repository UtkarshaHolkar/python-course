# # -------------------PYTHON-------------------

# Python Variables
# A variable is the name given to a memory location. A value-holding Python variable is also known as an identifier.

# Since Python is an infer language that is smart enough to determine the type of a variable, we do not need to specify its type in Python.

# Variable names must begin with a letter or an underscore, but they can be a group of both letters and digits.

# The name of the variable should be written in lowercase. Both Rahul and rahul are distinct variables.
